# SynResLoadPattern

Our released dataset *`SynResLoadPattern`*, comprises synthetic residential load patterns that effectively mirror the temporal dependencies and distribution characteristics found in the real-world training data. Providing a vast, diverse, and high-fidelity set of load patterns. This dataset is intended to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners for comprehensive analysis, simulation, and exploration in the domain of residential energy consumption.

## Data Description
*`SynResLoadPattern`* is comprised of 1,000,000 synthetic residential load pattern profiles, each of which denotes the normalized hourly electricity consumption within a day, with values ranging from 0 to 1. 

## Data Construction
These residential load pattern profiles were generated using our proposed RLP-GAN framework, trained on a real-world dataset obtained from the Pecan Street database. This original training set contains hourly load recordings of 417 households across the span of an entire year, from Jan. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2017, which were normalized to capture a wide range of daily load patterns and consumption behaviors.

## Dataset Location
The dataset is located under the following directory: [SynResLoadPattern](./SynResLoadPattern/SynResLoadPattern.csv)
